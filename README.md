# üñºÔ∏è Product Image Carousel Feature

# Overview

This is my submission for the Product Image Carousel challenge as part of the recruitment process.
It showcases a React and Bootstrap-based web application to add, view and explore product items, each with their own image carousel, description and pricing details with a focus on clean code, UI interactivity and great user experience.

# üöÄ Features

1. Add New Product Modal - Easily add a new a product via a form with inputs for:

- Product Name
- Description
- Price
- Multiple images

2. Success Popup - After a product is added, a success popup briefly appears to give instant feedback before disappearing automatically
3. Product Carousel Display - Added products are displayed in a responsive horizontal carousel showing:

- A product image
- Name and price
- Interactive hover effects

4. Product Details Modal - Clicking a product opens a centred modal showing:

- The product's name and full description
- A Bootstrap carousel to cycle through all the product's images
- A close button to return to the main view

5. Responsive Layout: Responsive design using Bootstrap Grid and utility classes. Optimized for both desktop and mobile.
6. Custom Styling - Custom CSS animations and effects for modals, buttons, cards, and image transistions, to ensure a polished and smooth UX.

# üß© Design Decisions & Logic

This section outlines the rationale behind the component structure and key logic implemented in the project.

üîß Component Structure:

- AddProduct.jsx: Handles product creation, including form validation and dynamic image upload. Features image preview, reordering, and deletion functionality before submission.

- Product.jsx: Represents each product in the carousel layout with hover effects and basic interactivity. Clicking a product opens the detail modal.

- ProductDetailsModal.jsx: Displays product info in a react-bootstrap modal with a smooth-fade image carousel. It handles dynamic rendering based on image count (e.g., hides carousel arrows for single images).

- App.jsx: Serves as the root component, managing state and rendering the entire interface, including the welcome screen and product carousel.

üéØ Key Logic

- Form Validation: The submit button remains disabled until all required fields (name, description, price, images) are filled. Native HTML5 validation provides feedback when hovering over incomplete fields.

- Image Management: Users can upload multiple images, which are previewed and can be reordered or removed before final submission.

- Carousel Display: Each product‚Äôs images are shown in a react-bootstrap carousel. Transitions are animated for a smooth UX.

- Accessibility: Modal and carousel components use aria roles (inherited via Bootstrap) to improve accessibility. Keyboard navigation and screen reader support are built-in.

- Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using flexbox, scroll snapping, and percentage-based widths. Cards remain legible and interactive across devices.

üß± CSS Modularity
CSS is scoped into relevant files (Product.css, AddProduct.css, ProductDetailsModal.css, App.css) to keep styling concerns isolated and maintainable. This separation of concerns improves readability and scalability.

# üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Tech Stack

- React (Functional Components, JSX) - (front-end)
- Bootstrap 5 (via react-bootstrap) - UI Framework
- Custom CSS, Bootstrap Utility Classes - Styling
- React Hooks (useState) - State Handling
- Bootstrap Carousel (native implementation)
- Custom fade-in-classes, transistions via CSS

# üìù Developer Notes to Take

- Bootstrap Carousel used instead of third-party libraries like react-slick, in line with the requirement to avoid many dependencies.
- Simple image input format (comma-separated URLs) ensures ease of use without overengineering.
- Carousel image transitions are native and smooth via Bootstrap.
- All modals are styled with subtle fade-in effects for better visual feedback.
- CSS is organized in modular files (App.css, ProductDetailsModal.css) to keep concerns separated.

# üîß Known Issues and Approach to Solving Them

‚úÖ Resolved Issues

- Image URL Field Handling
  Initially, users could add products without properly filling out the image URL or other fields.

Solution: Native HTML5 form validation is used to ensure all fields are required before allowing submission. Fields show browser-generated messages like "Please fill out this field" on hover or submit. In future, enhanced validation (e.g., image URL pattern checking or live previews) can be added for robustness.

- Products Not Persisting on Reload
  On refresh, all added products were lost.

Solution: Identified need for localStorage or backend integration, which is listed as a future improvement.

‚ö†Ô∏è Unresolved / Stretch Issues

- No Live Form Validation for URLs and Price

Planned Approach: Use JavaScript regex or URL() constructor for basic validation and error messages.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository - https://github.com/alexbray45/product-image-carousel.git
2. Navigate into the folder - cd product-carousel-app
3. Install dependencies - npm install
4. Run the app: npm run dev OR npm start

# üí° Future Improvements (Strech Goals)

- Add form validation for image URL, price and required fields
- Save products to local storage or a database for persistence
- Implement categories or tags for product filtering (search or sort by eg. Product name, Price)
- Improve accessibility with Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)
